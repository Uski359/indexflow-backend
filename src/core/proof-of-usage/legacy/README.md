## Proof of Usage (Experimental)

This folder contains an experimental, reference-only use case adapter that evaluates wallet activity against simple usage criteria.

Proof-of-Usage is a deterministic, explainable validation module exposed via a public API for pilot and grant validation.

- It consumes existing protocol queries in a read-only manner for demonstration purposes.
- It does not represent or alter the protocol core, which remains use-case agnostic.
- The contents here can be deleted without impacting IndexFlow.
- No core helpers or state are modified; everything is self-contained within this experimental folder.
